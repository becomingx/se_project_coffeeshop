# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project Description
A landing page for the Triple Espresso Coffee Shop. The page describes coffee recipes and the menu, allows booking of a table via form, and lists ways to contact the business.

## Plan on improving the project
The site needs a mobile-friendly version that adjusts to small screens. This could also improve how the site renders when a browser window is not full-screen.
